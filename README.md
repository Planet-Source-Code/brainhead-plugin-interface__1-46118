## Plugin Interface


</div>

### Description

Now UPDATED whit an example

There are 2 maps in the zipfile, in the map host you'll find a project and if you compile it, it will become the dll that your program has to use to let the plugins work.

The second map is named "Plugin" and there is an example of how your plugin can be made EVRY FILE that is in the project of the map of "plugin" is necesarly to let it work like it must except form1, you can change that and ofcourse can you add your own things. An other important thing is that the projectname and the name of the dll (plugindll) is the same.

PLEASE GIVE ME A GOOD RATE FOR THE CODE.

I've done a lot of research to acomplish this (al code is selfwritten, except if there is standing some reference to another coder in the module)
